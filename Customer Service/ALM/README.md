# Solution Component Validator

### Overview

Solution management is the core design tenet of any Dataverse/Dynamics 365 CE Implementation. Often, medium-to-complete engagements require multi-solution models where solutions are segmented by component types with mutual exclusivity. Developers need to adhere to the segmentation. 
Developers do not follow the guidelines to the solution segmentation which often leads to solution layering issues and dependency conflicts requiring fixes, post facto, that take months to finish and many support tickets/ ICMs to resolve layering issues.
This tool is built to provide proactive alerts on such deviations and help Devs, Leads, DevOps team maintain the agreed solution structures, while in the development stage itself, for Healthy ALM.
