## Usage
From the Microsoft D365 Finance and Operation click on; **Help and Support (?) > Trace > Batch Tracing**
When you first open the Batch Tracing form, the status will be **Not Read**
### Starting Tracing
Before you can start a trace, you need to start the **Tracing Batch Job**. To do this select the **Batch Tracing  Menu > Start Batch Tracing Batch Job**.
Once the batch job has started, the status will change from **Not Ready** to **Stopped**
> [!NOTE]  
> It can take some time for the status to change to **Stopped** after the batch job has started. This can depend on the number of batch servers.

With the status in a **Stopped** state, select the **Batch Tracing > Menu Start Tracing**.
This will update the status to **Start Requested**, and shortly after the status will change to **Starting** then **Started** or **Partially Started**. 
> [!NOTE]  
> **Partially Started**, means that the trace task couldnâ€™t be started on some of the batch servers. See the troubleshooting section below on how to prevent this. 
You can refresh the form while the trace is running to see the status and file size.

> [!NOTE]  
> If there is more than one batch server then the file size shown is the average of the traces over the servers.

### Stopping Tracing
You can stop a started or partially started trace by selecting **Batch Tracing  Menu > Stop Tracing**.
This will update the status to **Stop Requested**, and shortly after the status will change to **Stopping** then **Uploading** then **Stopped**.
You can refresh the form while the trace is running to see the status and file size. 
> [!NOTE]  
> If there is more than one batch server then the file size shown is the average of the traces over the servers.
