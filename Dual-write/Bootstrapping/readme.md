# Why do I need bootstrapping?
You might have an existing Common Data Service (CDS) or other Dynamics 365 app instance with business data, and you want to enable dual-write connection against it. In this case, you need to bootstrap Common Data Service or other Dynamics 365 app data with company information before enabling dual-write connection.
