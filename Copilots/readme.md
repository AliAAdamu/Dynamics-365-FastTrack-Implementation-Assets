# Copilots in Dynamics 365 Finance 

Copilots have changed the landscape of business and productivity apps and made AI the new UX. Lets see how copilots work in Dynamics 365 Finance and how these can be extended. This article will explore few copilot samples. With Power automate, we will build some low code but very powerful capabilities. When it comes to extensibility, Dynamics 365 for Finance offers three type of plugins, that extend the capabilities of copilot. 

1. **Low code plugins** –Microsoft Copilot Studio provides the orchestration of the AI capabilities for Copilot for finance and operations apps. Therefore, it enables a low-code maker experience for customizing the Copilot capabilities. You can utilize Power automate and its vast number of connectors to build some powerful capabilities.  

2. **Client plugins** - Client plugins, or client actions, are Microsoft Copilot plugins that invoke client code and are available for users in the context of client experiences for finance and operations apps. Developers can extend the Copilot chat capabilities in finance and operations apps by defining plugins that convert the functionality, operations, and business logic of the X++ code base into actions that users can invoke through natural language. For more information about client plugins and syntax, see Create client plugins for Copilot in finance and operations apps. 

3. **AI plugins** - AI plugins also extend the capabilities of copilot experiences in Microsoft Copilot Studio by using business logic in finance and operations X++ code. These plugins are headless operations that don't require specific application context in the finance and operations client. They can be added to Copilot for finance and operations apps to extend the in-app chat experience, or they can be added to other custom copilots. For more information, see Create AI plugins for copilots with finance and operations business logic. 

 

This document will focus on low code plugins and create three fully functional samples step by step.
